[Verse]
Haunted mansion renting
Confused soul shattered by life
Lost inside
Searching for light
Darkness surrounds
No end in sight
﻿
[Verse 2]
Whispers in the shadows
Haunting cries
Echo through the halls
Secrets disguised
Each room echoes with endless despair
A broken spirit
Trapped in this lair
﻿
[Chorus]
Lost inside these haunted walls
Yearning for a chance to break free
Searching for purpose
Searching for hope
In this labyrinth of misery
